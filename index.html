                <h2>Bloktopia Arcade</h2>
                <p>During my time at Bloktopia, i was responsible for a number of different features, particularly,
                    those relating to networking and bug fixes with Photon Fusion.</p>
                <p> My biggest task during this period was the development of a crypto arcade featuring a collection of both purchased and
                    original hypercasual games. There were 3 games in total : Bull Run, Crypto Rush and Crypto
                    Connect.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Bull Run</h3>
                <p>For Bull Run, I procured a game bundle from the Unity Asset Store (link below), meticulously
                    dissected it
                    and extracted the core components.
                    I then then tailored these components to align with our project's unique specifications. This
                    involved
                    implementing custom player characters,
                    refining scoring mechanisms, and enhancing game mechanics to achieve our desired outcomes. This
                    basically involved recreating the entire game from the ground up. </p>

                <p> The original game was called Downhill Ride and can be viewed <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZOni77t1iY.">here</a></p>

                <p> The video on the left shows the final game being played with my personal Bloktopia avatar, from the perspective of the player.  The video on the right shows the networking of the players score for other people in the arcade.</p>

            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>Crypto Rush</h3>
                <p>Crypto Rush is a completely original game, in which i had full freedom of choice over the design, gameplay and development.  </p>
                <p> It is a time based game where the user must sort different coins by placing them in the correct wallet.
                    The 2 coins are Ethereum, which appear on the right and BitCoin which appears on the left.
                    The player is presented with a randomly ordered list containing both coins, and they must either press left if
                    it is BitCoin and right if it is Ethereum.  The goal is to sort as many coins as possible before the timer runs out.</p>
                
                <p>I created networking for the game where by other users can enter the proximity of 
                an ongoing game and see the actual coins being sorted. This was done using minimal networking traffic, leveraging our custom networking architecture to incorporate in game updates.
                   </p>

                <p>The video on the left shows the game being played from the perspective of someone playing the game while the video on the right shows the networking of the gameplay and score. </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Crypto Connect (Hex Game)</h3>
                <p>Crypto Connect or Hex, is a UI based game where user must use their mouse to connect tiles.   Like Bull Run,  It was procured from a game bundle on the Unity Asset store.  However the final version required
                    much less dissection from the original game.   The main difficulty with this game bundle was to condense all gameplay into a single scene and then import it into Bloktopia and making it playable from a dedicated non networked scene.   I then added custom functionality for saving and loading a game before, finally, giving it a Bloktopia themed art design.</p>
                <p> The more tiles a user can connect, the higher their score goes.  Tiles are replaced with higher value tiles after they have been connected, this makes them harder to connect with other tiles but yield more score.  
                    The game will end when ther are no available tiles left on the screen to connect.</p>


                <p> The original game was called Hex and can be viewed <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTRqIsjj02M">here</a></p>

                <p>The below video shows me entering the hex scene with my Bloktopia avatar.  It also shows the save and load feature, where i quit the ongoing game and return back to it moments later. </p>

                <h2>Bionic Blitz</h2>
                <p>BionicBlitz is a fast-paced and chaotic, cross-platform, arcade game. You play as OddBot, a cheeky,
                    playful robot who must drain power from enemy entities
                    as fast he can, while at the same time, avoiding and disabling other entities who chase Oddbot on
                    sight.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It was released on February 2019, on both Steam and mobile (Android) platforms.</p>

                    unlockable power ups, online leader-boards,
                    a complex and strategic game-play loop as well as progressively strong enemy entities who have their
                    own strengths and weaknesses, and their
                    own unique ways of attacking OddBot.</p>

                <p>Trick or Treat is the first of a series of festivities themed local/online multiplayer shooter games.
                    The setting is Halloween night and based around the concept of fireworks and eggs over guns and grenades.
                    The goal is to destroy the other teams base, by throwing eggs at it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This game contains a fully functioning 3D Ragdoll system and a complex pooling system.
                    The architecture follows a state machine based interface which implements game state as well as Player and Ragdoll states.</p>
                <br>

                <p>This is a project I am working on solo, which I began during the Covid-19 pandemic.  It is inspired by my favorite game as a child : Street Fighter.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This game uses enemy and character scripts which both inherit from an interface named IEntity. The IEntity interface must implement 3 other interfaces named IAnimate, IControllable and IAttack.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The architectural choice to use an interface of interfaces makes it extremely easy to implement new features and develop enemy AI and player characters alongside each other with a very similar structure. This allows for easy bug fixing and scalability.</p>
