                <h2>Bloktopia Arcade</h2>
                <p>During my time at Bloktopia, i was responsible for a number of different features, particularly,
                    those relating to networking and bug fixes with Photon Fusion.</p>
                <p> My biggest task during this period was the development of a crypto arcade featuring a collection of
                    both purchased and
                    original hypercasual games. There were 3 games in total : Bull Run, Crypto Rush and Crypto
                    Connect.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Bull Run</h3>
                <p>For Bull Run, I procured a game bundle from the Unity Asset Store (link below), meticulously
                    dissected it
                    and extracted the core components.
                    I then then tailored these components to align with our project's unique specifications. This
                    involved
                    implementing custom player characters,
                    refining scoring mechanisms, and enhancing game mechanics to achieve our desired outcomes. This
                    basically involved recreating the entire game from the ground up. </p>

                <p> The original game was called Downhill Ride and can be viewed <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZOni77t1iY.">here</a></p>

                <p> The video below shows the final game being played from the
                    perspective of both the player and others users in the arcade, showing the desired networking experience..</p>
                <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>Crypto Rush</h3>
                <p>Crypto Rush is a completely original game, in which i had full freedom of choice over the design,
                    gameplay and development. </p>
                <p> It is a time based game where the user must sort different coins by placing them in the correct
                    wallet.
                    The 2 coins are Ethereum, which appear on the right and BitCoin which appears on the left.
                    The player is presented with a randomly ordered list containing both coins, and they must either
                    press left if
                    it is BitCoin and right if it is Ethereum. The goal is to sort as many coins as possible before the
                    timer runs out.</p>

                <p>I created networking for the game where by other users can enter the proximity of
                    an ongoing game and see the actual coins being sorted. This was done using minimal networking
                    traffic, leveraging our custom networking architecture to incorporate in game updates.
                </p>

                <p>The video shows the game being played from both the perspective of someone playing the game
                   aw well as someone observing the game, displaying the networking of the players score and progress. </p>
                <br>

            <br>
            <div>
                <h3>Crypto Connect (Hex Game)</h3>
                <p>Crypto Connect or Hex, is a UI based game where user must use their mouse to connect tiles. Like Bull
                    Run, It was procured from a game bundle on the Unity Asset store. However the final version required
                    much less dissection from the original game. The main difficulty with this game bundle was to
                    condense all gameplay into a single scene and then import it into Bloktopia and making it playable
                    from a dedicated non networked scene. I then added custom functionality for saving and loading a
                    game before, finally, giving it a Bloktopia themed art design.</p>
                <p> The more tiles a user can connect, the higher their score goes. Tiles are replaced with higher value
                    tiles after they have been connected, this makes them harder to connect with other tiles but yield
                    more score.
                    The game will end when ther are no available tiles left on the screen to connect.</p>


                <p> The original game was called Hex and can be viewed <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTRqIsjj02M">here</a></p>

                <p>The below video shows me entering the hex scene with my Bloktopia avatar. It also shows the save and
                    load feature, where i quit the ongoing game and return back to it moments later. </p>

                <h2>BlokBuster</h2>
                <p>BlokBuster is a multiplayer trivia game where players from all over the world can join in, with up to
                    800 participants playing at any time. In the game, players answer questions by rushing to designated
                    zones corresponding to multiple-choice answers within tight time limits.
                    If you go to the wrong zone, you are eliminated.  The game continues until no players are left or until all rounds are played.  If you’re still in the game at the end of the final
                    round, you’re a winner!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The game leverages a hybrid architecture that integrates Photon Fusion and Azure Hubs. Photon Fusion
                    handled the networking of normal user based interactions as well as sending round and game data from
                    a host machine (master client) to all players in the room.
                    On top of that, Azure Hubs keeps everyone in a group and manages player states. When a player
                    updates their state locally, that update goes to the Azure Hub.
                    Then, the host reads the data and shares it with everyone in the room, so each player’s state is
                    properly synchronized.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The token Ticker system was one of the most fundamental aspects of the Bloktopia metaverse. It
                    allows users to view real-time up to date token price updates for a variety of cryptocurrencies,
                    directly within the metaverse environment.
                    The system enabled users to filter and sort coins based on daily gainers and losers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> It utilized CoinMarketCap and DexTools APIs to provide accurate and current data.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> The below video shows all the Ticker types that this system incorporates.  There are Single display tickers for individual coins, Horizontally scrolling tickers for a list of individual coins, top 10 coins made accessible through Coin Market Cap API as well as 
                    an interactable display where you can view daily winners/losers for a coin of your choosing.

                <p>BionicBlitz is a fast-paced and chaotic, cross-platform, arcade game. You play as OddBot, a cheeky,
                    playful robot who must drain power from enemy entities
                    as fast he can, while at the same time, avoiding and disabling other entities who chase Oddbot on

                <p>It was released on February 2019, on both Steam and mobile (Android) platforms.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This game is multi lingual, cross-platform and contains ads on the mobile version. It also has

                <h2>The Chicken and The Fox</h2>
                <p>The Chicken and the Fox is the first of a series of childrens books. It is a joint collaboration
                    between TopBox Studio and promising children's book author, Randol Taylor. </p>
                <br>
                <p>It is a multi-lingual children's book that weaves an informative
                    narrative with an engaging story through an interactive journey
                    that combines fun with learning, offering a delightful experience for young readers.</p>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    There are many interactive features, where, young readers not only enjoy a captivating tale but also
                    actively participate in the learning experience.</p>
                <br>

                <p> This app is seperated into 2 different projects.  An uploader project was created for storing assets and creating the actual content for each book. This project ensures that the art and content are kept separate from the main project, facilitating
                    easier content management and enabling the production of multiple books using the same system.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>  It contains custom editor code that generates asset bundles from
                    scene layouts, text elements and audio data.  These assets are stored in the persistent data folder where the main project reads them from.  Before the book is released, these assets will be placed on Azure Blob Storage.
                    
      
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The main project is designed to manage and present each book in Unity. It processes a list of asset
                    bundles for the specific book the user wants to read.
                    <br>
                   
                <br>
                <p>Below is a small snippet showcasing the main features of the book. There are 25 pages in total each with their own set of facts and interactables.
                    The target platform for the project is Android and I phone.</p>

                   <h2>Macro Tracker</h2>
                   <p>Macro Tracker allows users to scan food barcodes by utilizing the Open Food Facts free API. It
                       displays detailed nutritional information for each food item and lets users store the items in a
                       local database.

                   <br>
                   <p> Users can combine multiple foods to construct meals and see the total macronutrient breakdown of the

                   <h2>Trick or Treat (work in progress)</h2>
                   <p>Trick or Treat is the first of a series of festivities themed local/online multiplayer shooter games.
                       The setting is Halloween night and based around the concept of fireworks and eggs over guns and
                       grenades.
                       The goal is to destroy the other teams base, by throwing eggs at it.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>This game contains a fully functioning 3D Ragdoll system and a complex pooling system.
                       The architecture follows a state machine based interface which implements game state as well as
                       Player and Ragdoll states.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Here is a clip of the local multiplayer shooting with the ragdoll physics in effect. The ability to
                       throw eggs will be added soon!</p>

                   <h2>3D Street Figther (work in progress)</h2>
                   <p>This is a project I am working on solo. It is inspired by my favorite game as a child : Street
                       Fighter.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>This game uses enemy and character scripts which both inherit from an interface named IEntity. The
                       IEntity interface must implement 3 other interfaces named IAnimate, IControllable and IAttack.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>The architectural choice to use an interface of interfaces makes it extremely easy to implement new
                       features and develop enemy AI and player characters alongside each other with a very similar
                       structure. This allows for easy bug fixing and scalability.</p>
